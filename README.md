## 🛠️ **How to Run the Projects**

### ✅ **Requirements:**
- Python 3.x ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
- Updated `pip` package manager  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab *(optional but recommended for interactive code execution)*  

### 🚀 **Steps to run locally:**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabvinhola/alura.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired course folder:**
   ```bash
   cd alura/python_para_data_science_primeiros_passos
   ```
3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```
4. **Install dependencies (if required):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Run the notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

> 💡 **Tip:** Prefer not to install anything? Easily open and run the notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading the files or using the GitHub import feature.
